# MPL_Trickle

This directory contains sources for our submitted paper for VVIOT2019.

It contains : 
- A source file (MPL_modeling_T1.xlia) for modeling a node and interactions between all nodes in topology T1
- A workflow file (workflow_Update_all_nodes.sew) for executing our heuristics to cover the sequence SEQ1 + FOR1 detailed in the paper. This objective coverage finishes when all nodes in the topology are updated


## Getting Started

PlantUML is used to give a visualization of our result under the form of sequence diagram. 

For this, you need to download PlantUML here : http://plantuml.com/download


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

After executing the workflow, we obtain the result of symbolic execution. An illustration for this result is found in the file /output/basic/symbex_sequence.txt.
